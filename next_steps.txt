Next Steps:
- Low-hanging fruit
 1. Schedulers
 2. Add resource logging
 3. Upscalers
 4. Add image metadata & gallery

- Text-to-Image Model Architectures to Support:
 1. SD 2.1/2.0 (No fine-tunes)
 2. SD3/SD3.5 (No fine-tunes)
 3. SDXL Turbo
 4. Flux/Flux 2
 5. Z-Image (text-2-image up, pending img2img)
 6. AuraFlow
 7. Kandinsky
 8. Kolors
 9. Lumina
 10. Auraflow/PixArt
 11. QwenImage
 12. Wuerstrchen

- Features
 1. Embeddings
 2. LoRAs and their variants
 3. ControlNet, ControlNetXS, ControlNetUnion

Current implementation flaw:
- Pipeline does not clear at end of render
- OOM issues

Tools required:
1. Find what layers a file has (TE, Unet, DiT, etc) for better modelling
2. Tool to accurately track resource consumption (System RAM, VRAM)
